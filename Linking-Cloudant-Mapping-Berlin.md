## Cloudant and Mapping Berlin

The first step to customizing the Mapping Berlin for your own projects is swapping out the current Cloudant database for your own. Just follow these easy steps:

### Create a Database in Cloudant (or use and existing database)

#### Make sure Databases is selected and then click on *Create Database*

### Create a New View

#### Click on the + next to *Design Documents* and select *New View*

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/8dVONv5.png)

#### Follow the illustration below.  Your design document should be named *tour*, the index name is *1970* and the map function should say the following:

``
function (doc) {
  if (doc.properties.tour == "1970") {emit(doc._id, doc);}
}
``

### Create a Search Index

#### Click on the + next to your newly created view called *tour* and select *New Search Index*

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/x3OGNhC.png)

#### Name your index *ids*, and paste in the following code for the search index function:

``
function(doc){
  index("default", doc.properties.title);
  if (doc._rev){
    index("rev", doc._rev, {"store": "yes"});
  }
  if(doc.properties.title){
    index("title", doc.properties.title, {"store": "yes"});
  }
}
``

### Linking your Cloudant Database to Mapping Berlin

#### Go to your forked copy of the Mapping Berlin Github repository and switch from the Master branch to the gh-pages branches.  All your changes will be made on the gh-pages branch!
*If you forked this repository over 2 weeks ago you will need to update your fork as there have been significant changes. If updating becomes too complicated, simply delete your existing fork and refork the repository from HeardLibrary/mapping-berlin.*

#### Open the Scripts folder on your gh-pages branch

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/rD9s5lG.png)

#### Click on the maps.js file

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/VgqYw3G.png)

#### To edit this file, click on the pencil icon to the right

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/DO8GfFs.png)

#### Replace the URLs linking the repository to the Heard Library's cloudant database your your own cloudant database URL.  Everywhere you see https://vulibrarygis.cloudant.com/map-berlin, replace that portion of the URL with your database URL.  For example, my database URL is https://ramonav.cloudant.com/open-gis.
#### You will make these changes at line:  85, 124, 140 and 159.
