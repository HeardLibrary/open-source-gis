      <h1>Vanderbilt Open Source GIS Working Group</h1>

      <p><em>Open to all members of the Vanderbilt community.  Traditionally we meet every Thursday at noon, but this may change in the fall.  We are currently on a summer hiatus.</em></p>

      <p>In this working group we look at various open source Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools. Some of these tools include: PosgreSQL/PostGIS, Mapbox/Leaflet, Geoserver, and QGIS. Many of these programs are used to create, store, edit, serve out, and analyze geographic data. All of these tools present an alternative to costly GIS software, such as ArcGIS. In this working group, weâ€™ll take turns teaching each other the basics of how to use these tools and transfer skills across disciplines. Working group members can also use this time to present their own spatial problems with the group. The Open Source GIS working group is informal and open to any that wish to attend.  For more information, please contact lindsey.fox@vanderbilt.edu</p>

      <h2>Working Group Objectives</h2>

      <h3>Working Group Members May Come Away With:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>general knowledge of open source technologies used in GIS</li>
        <li>introductory-level understanding of such technologies</li>
        <li> more in-depth knowledge of more specific tools</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Required materials</h3>

      <h3>Fall 2016 Schedule</h3>
      <p>Each month we will tackle a new topic.  During that month we will spend various weeks covering new technologies and discussing methodoogy associated with that topic.  Members are also welcome to suggest comments or suggestions as to which technologies they would like to cover.  We also like to distribute sessions between members, so if leading a session is something you are interested in doing, please contact Lindsey Fox </p>
